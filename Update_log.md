- The default is for keeping other music links
- Individual downloading is done by passing the flag -F or --file_name while executing the program with values [M,H,T,W] which represents the corresponding files to look for for downloading

````py
$ python Muzic_Manager.py -F H
````

# Version 2.0
- Changed the format of adding links
- In previous version the link and the title were separated using space hence the title could not have any space thus '_' had to be used instead
- Now the space is removed instead ';' is used to separate link and title thus from this version title can have spaces
# VERSION 1.0
- Add links to the download.txt file and the program downloads links on each line
